## **Introduction**

This report explores global **vaccination coverage[^1]** This report explores the critical role of vaccination in enhancing public health. Our analysis shows that between **2000 and 2023,** global vaccination coverage increased by **20%**, while average life expectancy rose by 10 years. Regional data reveals that countries with strong economic and healthcare support achieve vaccination rates above **90%**, compared to around 70% in less resourced¬†nations.

## üìà **Vaccination Coverage and Life Expectancy Over Time**

Between 2000 and 2023, global vaccination coverage[^1] climbed from 65% to 85%, mirroring life expectancy gains.

**"On avg. close to 85% of the global population was immunized¬†as¬†of¬†2022"**

**Pandemic Impact (2020‚Äì2021)**
During 2020 and 2021, both vaccination coverage and life expectancy experienced a noticeable dip, coverage fell from roughly 85% down to 82%, while life expectancy dipped by 0.5 years. This reversal aligns with the global COVID-19 crisis, which strained healthcare systems, disrupted routine immunization campaigns, and diverted resources toward emergency response. It highlights the vulnerability of preventive health services during major outbreaks and underscores the need for resilient delivery systems that can maintain essential vaccinations even under pandemic pressures.
